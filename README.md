# Unit Converter (Svelte + TS + Vite)

Welcome! This is a simple side project: a website for converting between different units (like temperature, volume, and length). Built with Svelte, TypeScript, and Vite—mostly for fun and learning.

## What does it do?

- Convert temperatures (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, etc.)
- Convert volumes (liters, gallons, cups, etc.)
- Convert lengths (meters, feet, inches, etc.)
- More units may be added if I get bored enough

## Why?

Because sometimes you just want to know how many teaspoons are in a gallon, or what 451°F is in Celsius. Also, I wanted to play with Svelte and Vite.

## How to run it

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and convert away!

## Tech Stack

- Svelte (for the UI)
- TypeScript (for fewer bugs, hopefully)
- Vite (for fast builds and hot reloads)
